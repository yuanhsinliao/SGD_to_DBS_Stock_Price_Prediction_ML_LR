#### Singapore Dollar to DBS Stock Price Prediction

This project focuses on predicting DBS stock prices based on Singapore Dollar (SGD) exchange rates. The dataset used in this analysis is stored in Google Drive and contains historical SGD exchange rates against various currencies. Linear regression is employed to establish a predictive model for DBS stock prices using SGD exchange rates.

#### Contents:
- **Introduction**: Overview of the project and its objectives.
- **Data Loading**: Description of loading the dataset from Google Drive using pandas.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Explanation of selecting relevant features (SGD exchange rates) and target variable (DBS stock prices).
- **Modeling**: Utilization of linear regression for building the predictive model.
- **Model Evaluation**: Calculation of root mean squared error (RMSE) to evaluate the model's performance.
- **Results**: Display of model coefficients and intercept, along with the RMSE value.
- **Conclusion**: Summary of findings and potential next steps.

#### Singapore Dollar to DBS Stock Price Prediction

This project aims to predict DBS stock prices using historical Singapore Dollar (SGD) exchange rates. Here's an overview of the project:

- **Data Source**: The dataset "DBS_SingDollar.csv" is obtained from Google Drive, containing SGD exchange rates and corresponding DBS stock prices.
- **Data Preprocessing**: SGD exchange rates are selected as features (X) and DBS stock prices as the target variable (Y). No data cleaning or feature engineering is performed as the dataset is assumed to be clean.
- **Modeling Approach**: Linear regression is chosen as the predictive model due to its simplicity and interpretability.
- **Model Evaluation**: Root mean squared error (RMSE) is used to measure the performance of the linear regression model.
- **Results**: The model's coefficients and intercept are obtained, and RMSE value is calculated.
- **Conclusion**: The project concludes with insights into the predictive capabilities of the linear regression model and potential avenues for further improvement.
